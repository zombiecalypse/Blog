</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>As the modern idea of democracy rose to its contemporary positive connotation,
many theorists held that direct democracy was the ideal, but impractical. Locke&nbsp;said </p>
<p><em>[&#8230;] For if the consent of the majority shall not, in reason, be received as the act of the whole, and conclude every individual; nothing but the consent of every individual can make any thing to be the act of the whole: but such a consent is next to impossible ever to be had, if we consider the infirmities of health, and avocations of business, which in a number, though much less than that of a commonwealth, will necessarily keep many away from the public assembly. [&#8230;]</em> (Sect. 98 Second Treatise of&nbsp;Government)</p>
<p>and for Rousseau, only
a small community ensures happiness for its members, because he held it
impossible to have immediate contact in a larger context. These constraints do
not apply as much as they did when the theories were first developed -
geographical distance is but a minor inconvenience in the information age. In
reaction to the possibilities that this gives society, delegated voting
(<em>Designing a Democratic System Based on Voluntary Vote-Delegation</em> <a href="http://www.econ.ucsb.edu/~armytage/proxy2012.pdf">pdf</a>,  James
Green-Armytage) as an alternative  to or synthesis of both representative and
direct systems had been proposed. In this essay I will analyse how the novel
idea fits into the framework that were the basis for the first modern
democratic systems in America and France - <strong>Locke</strong> and <strong>Rousseau</strong>. As I firmly believe that one has to
test their theories against the strongest opponents, I will also add <strong>Tocqueville</strong> to the list of proponents I will compare&nbsp;to. </p>
<h2>Delegated&nbsp;Voting</h2>
<p>Before comparing it to classical approaches, I will shortly introduce the
concept of delegated voting. Like other approaches, every citizen has one vote
and as in a direct democratic setting, this vote can be cast on issues of
public interest, not only for candidates. The novel approach is that the vote
can be transferred from one person to another, that is, I can not only cast my
vote directly for an proposal, but also for the opinion of another fellow
voter, so that they not only decide where their own vote goes, but also where
the votes of the people who vote for them go. I might choose that my expertise
is not sufficient of an issue and lay my trust on an expert, thus closing the
gap between direct voting and&nbsp;representation. </p>
<p>To this goal it has also been proposed that the delegation can be restricted to
a specific field of expertise. This of course leads to a significant power to
those able to define the category of a proposal. Even now, where the influence
is only an informal one, the framing of an proposal can make or break it. If
the minaret initiative had been discussed as an issue of personal freedom or
business interests (how many jobs could be created by building a minaret in
each village), the proposal might well have taken a different turn. Adding to
that that different people decide on the proposal, depending on what aspect is
chosen, one can only imagine how significant this decision would have&nbsp;been.</p>
<h2>Locke</h2>
<p>In Locke&#8217;s <em>Two Treatises on Government</em> he sets up a scenario of an anarchical
society and argues that for granted property rights and justice, such a society
would introduce a social contract and erect a government. He further argues
that this government would be an representative democracy, because the parties
of the social contract could not decide in a collective, that is a direct
democracy is only possible in a small community. The validity of his argument
can be seen in that even in Switzerland, policy decisions are seldom decided by
the people and for most questions of public interest, its directness is only&nbsp;theoretical. </p>
<p>This could be changed with todays technology, a public discourse of the whole
population can take place in the time a law is proposed until the decision is
made. Public media and especially the internet allow a voter to get many
relevant information. A politically interested citizen can be as informed as
politicians about issues of their choosing. Even politicians can hardly know
every nuance of an issue. Often highly technical issues are decided by people,
who only understand them from a second hand perspective. Locke asserts, that a
politician can find a well rounded view on every decision, but that I think
ceased to be the case, if it ever was. To decide for example, if the patent law
needs to be revised, we&#8217;d first need to understand what 
the current laws allow, what causes problems and finally what law could prevent these problems. The first assessment alone would take a person years, or weeks&nbsp;optimistically. </p>
<p>Since Locke based his treatises on a thought experiment resulting in a social contract, I propose to go through the steps of reasoning in the light of advancing technology. In the natural state, humans are free and generally respectful to each other, but exploitation exists and needs to be accounted for. Without laws, everyone is legislature and judge in one, which leads to unfairness and insecurity about what to expect from each other. This culminates in the people agreeing on a social contract, in which they pass this power to a newly created entity - the state. However, the people would not give that freedom away, without retaining as much as possible, so that the goal of a unified legislature and judiciary is still achieved. For this reason, it would not make sense to give away the right to decide on policy, except for practical considerations.<br />
</p>
<p>While Locke was the Father of the the democracies of England and America, the continental European democracies developed under heavy influence of Rousseau.
