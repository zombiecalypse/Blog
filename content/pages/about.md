Title: About me

Hi, my name is Aaron Karper and I'm currently studying Computer Science at the
[University of Bern](http://www.iam.unibe.ch/en). You might know me from
lectures like *Programming 2* and *Introduction to Software Engineering* for which I'm TA.

Currently I'm working on my [Bachelor thesis](https://github.com/zombiecalypse/Bachelor-Thesis)
on computability theory. Besides that, I believe that you should never stop
giving in to your curiosity, so I'm constantly expanding my knowledge in many
branches of computer science like *artificial intelligence*, *category theory*,
and *parallelism*.

I'm also a programming language aesthete and learned the basic (and more) of
languages such as *Common Lisp*, *Clojure*, *Haskell*, *C/++*, *Ruby*,
*Python*, *Prolog*, *Java*, and some others.
