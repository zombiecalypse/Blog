Hi, my name is Aaron Karper and I'm currently studying Computer Science at the
`University of Bern <http://www.iam.unibe.ch/en>`_. You might know me from
lectures like *Programming 2* and *Introduction to Software Engineering* for which I'm TA.

Currently I'm working on my `Bachelor thesis <https://github.com/zombiecalypse/Bachelor-Thesis>`_ 
on computability theory. Besides that, I believe that you should never stop
giving in to your curiosity, so I'm constantly expanding my knowledge in many
branches of computer science like *artificial intelligence*, *category theory*,
and *parallelism*.

I'm also a programming language aesthete and learned the basic (and more) of
languages such as *Common Lisp*, *Clojure*, *Haskell*, *C/++*, *Ruby*,
*Python*, *Prolog*, *Java*, and some others.
