<h2>Rousseau</h2>
<p>Contrary to Locke, who purposes a indirect government in order to extend it to a sufficiently big area, Rousseau held that this was actually a reason, why states should not extend beyond local communities. He assumed that this would lead to less corrupted human beings, who would easily find a consensus. At first glance, it seems ridiculous to say that the internet and other communication technologies would lead humankind to a more natural and more empathic state, one only needs to look at the average discussion on the Web to at least doubt that. Then again, Rousseau failed to provide a proof for his claim in the first place, so what the&#8221;natural human being&#8221; would do is still very much up to&nbsp;discussion. </p>
<p>We can however analyse how delegated voting would influence the communication structure that would lead to a political decision. For this, one needs to look at the ways, the public can communicate with their leaders today: the media could pick up the story to bring it to the attention of the politicians, but the incentive to do do requires the story to be interesting and concrete. One could also contact the politician directly, but due to the personal distance, one might decide not to do so, if the issue is not very&nbsp;pressing. </p>
<p>This direct way of communication would be influenced by the voting system, because one would typically choose delegates that one trusts. It is of course easier to extend trust to people one reckons to know, so many delegates will be from the personal environment of the voter. This at least comes closer than a national state with a parliament to Rousseau&#8217;s ideal&nbsp;order. </p>
<p>However, the transitivity of the delegation might remove the person, who actually makes the decision, even further from the voter. It might well be the case that the voter has no personal connection to the delegate and might not even have heard of&nbsp;them. </p>
<p>In The Social Contract, Rousseau argues that no law is legit unless it is the people, who decided on it. For this, delegate voting offers a more realistic implementation than plainly voting every issue: through delegates, one does not need to invest information cost for voting, if one does not wish&nbsp;to. </p>
<p>In conclusion I would say that, while not as clearly as Locke, Rousseau would be in favour of a delegated voting&nbsp;system. </p>
<p>In the <a href="../../2013/Jan/delegated-voting-and-classical-theorists-iii.html">next part</a> <strong>Tocqueville</strong> will get his say - who argued that there is a
something as too much democracy and surely wouldn&#8217;t be a huge fan of delegated&nbsp;voting.</p>
