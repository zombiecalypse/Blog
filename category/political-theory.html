<h2>Tocqueville</h2>
<p>Tocqueville argues against too much democracy of a state, because it fails to protect minorities against the despotism of the majority. Further, it leads to dull leaders, because the sharp ones are put off by being a puppet to the public and short terms lead to preferring short-sighted to long-term&nbsp;solutions. </p>
<h3>Short-sighted&nbsp;legislates</h3>
<p>Compared to regular indirect democracies, this is even more problematic with delegated voting: the &#8220;term&#8221; of elected officials could potentially be arbitrary short for every domain to which the delegation principle extends (which I will assume to be only the&nbsp;legislature). </p>
<p>As Ernesto Dal Bó and Martin Rossi show (<a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w14511"><em>Term Length and Political Performance</em></a>), being held accountable frequently in the form of elections will decrease the performance consistently across several metrics contrary to what models (by Barro and Ferejohn) would imply, as they argue due to time horizon effects - there is less incentive to invest in the long term, if one might never see it, especially since it might harm the popularity in the short&nbsp;term. </p>
<p>It remains to be seen if this effect reoccurs in a delegates voting system, where there is no fixed term and no election binary, but while these differences are significant and could well turn the effect around, as it is this remains a possible disadvantage of system that is, should it occur, inherent to&nbsp;it.</p>
<h3>Protection of&nbsp;Minorities</h3>
<p>Tocqueville (and Mills similarly) further argues, that a democracy needs to take additional measures to protect minorities, because the leaders and the public opinion push in the same direction. If one is opposed to that direction, one faces not only legal consequences, but also social disapproval. The reverse is even more true: a norm might quickly ascend to a law in a direct democracy, as seen with the minaret&nbsp;initiative. </p>
<p>This problem however is not one that is inherent to liquid democracy and more connected to direct democracy in general. The measures against it are well studies, such as a additional barrier in changing the most fundamental laws, the&nbsp;constitution. </p>
<p>Often enough, the interpretation of these laws of minimal consensus is not as clear as one would hope - one might even argue that the consensus was only found by leaving the interpretation somewhat open. So even if there was some corpus of laws that we accept as fundamental and eternal, then we would still need an instance that provides a binding interpretation. According to Tocqueville, this instance has to be independent from any public&nbsp;influence.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>It is very easy to defend liquid democracy from a participatory standpoint, but as we have seen, the concept fits very well into the classical theories of Locke and Rousseau.  It also shares the weaknesses as described by Tocqueville which can not be completely&nbsp;dismissed. </p>
<p>Liquid democracy might therefore well have been the conclusion of the social contact thought experiments if they took modern technology into&nbsp;account.</p>                </article>
